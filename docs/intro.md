## Introduction 

Here at CLS we have genetic data for three cohorts: the 1958 Childhood Development Study (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). This wiki provides documentation on the genetic QC for these datasets and what is available to researchers.

The genetic data is managed by CLS at UCL (<https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/>). 

To access genetic data combined with survey data, please see <https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/data-access-training/data-access/>. (i.e., complete the application form which is then reviewed approximately monthly in data access committee meetings).

## Updates:
- Forthcoming: QC'd data in each cohort and polygenic scores (see link below)
