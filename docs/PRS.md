# Polygenic risk scores 

## Our Aim

We aim to generate and make polygenic risk scores (PRS) available for CLS cohorts using a standardised pipeline which is transparent, efficient, and updatable. Our approach to sharing these data seeks to balance the ethical need to make data available to enable research with the ethical need to avoid potential risks.

Cohorts The cohorts we will be generating PRS for are the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS), the 1958 National Childhood Development Study (NCDS) and the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70). In the future when genotyping is completed for Next Steps, PRS will be generated using the same pipeline.

## Data availability

We aim to make the PRS available to researchers in the coming months.
