# **Polygenic risk scores** 

## Our Aim

We aim to generate and make polygenic risk scores (PRS) available for CLS cohorts using a standardised pipeline which is transparent, efficient, and updatable. Our approach to sharing these data seeks to balance the ethical need to make data available to enable research with the ethical need to avoid potential risks.

This will be for multiple health and social traits.


## Data availability

Forthcoming / in preparation. Please email clsdata@ucl.ac.uk for updates.
