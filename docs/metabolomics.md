# **Metabolomics** 
The NCDS Age 62 (Sweep 10) survey collected non-fasted blood samples from consenting participants. From these samples, metabolomic analyses were conducted.

Metabolomics is the study of small molecules, or metabolites, within cells, tissues, or organisms, providing a snapshot of biochemical activity and physiological status. The metabolomics analysis was conducted by Nightingale Health using the samples. The serum tubes were collected by health professionals in the homes of participants where they were centrifuged prior to being posted to the Bristol Bioresource Laboratory (BBL), where samples were stored in 0.5 ml aliquots at -80C. Serum samples were available for 5,082 participants. One aliquot per participant was shipped to Nightingale Health (Helsinki, Finland) from BBL. The analysis used Nightingale Health's proprietary 1H NMR Spectroscopy platform to quantify 250 biomarkers (Appendix 1 of the User Guide), providing a detailed snapshot of participants' biochemical and physiological status at the time of interview.

# **Data availability**
The NCDS metabolomics data are available via the [UK Data Service](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=9411) under Special License.
