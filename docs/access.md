# **Data access** 

Pseudonymised genomic data are available without charge to the global research community upon data application request. 

There are two access procedures depending on the data that you would like to request, as outlined below.

# **Genomewide genetic data (raw and imputed)** 


# **Polygenic indexes, proteomics and metabolomics** 
To access genetic data combined with survey data, please see link (i.e., complete the application form which is then reviewed approximately monthly in data access committee meetings; the same process applies to internal and external applicants). 

The CLS Data Access Framework gives further details on the application process, including details on ethics and socially controversial research. The flowchart below shows the access procedure through the CLS DAC.


# **Approved applications** 
A list of approved applications can be found on the CLS website here.
