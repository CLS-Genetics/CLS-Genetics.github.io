# **Introduction** 

The Centre for Longitudinal Studies ([CLS](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk)) maintains genetic data from four British birth cohorts: the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), Next Steps (1989-90), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS, 2000-02). This site provides technical documentation and access information for researchers.

See our [data resource profile paper](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/54/5/dyaf141/8237599) for background.

## Data Access

Pseudonymised genomic data and polygenic indices/scores are available without charge to the global research community upon data application request.

For information about how to access CLS genetic data please see the [Data Access page](/docs/access.html).  

## Contribute to GWAS or other consortia

We are happy to contribute to GWAS or other consortia, please [contact us](mailto:clsdata@ucl.ac.uk).  

## Genetic data

There are two main types of genomic data available to researchers at present: genotype array data and genotype array data imputed to sequence level density. Imputation has been performed several times as new sequenced reference panels become available.  

## Updates:

- **Resource profile paper now published**: See [here](https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/54/5/dyaf141/8237599).
- **Coming 2025**: Polygenic scores for multiple health and social traits ([details](/docs/PRS.html))
- **2024**: TOPMed imputation completed across all cohorts
