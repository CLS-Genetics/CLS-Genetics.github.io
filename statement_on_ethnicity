# **Statement on Ancestry** 

Genetic analyses have predominantly been conducted on samples of European ancestry. This emphasis on a specific population group has arisen because of several reasons, including data availability, research resources (e.g. the availability of funding, expertise, technology, and infrastructure needed to collect, process, and analyse genetic data), underrepresentation of some population groups in research, and historical biases.  

It is important to acknowledge this potential limitation in research – for example, results solely examining those of European ancestry may not generalise to other ancestral groups and therefore the entire population of interest. This includes analyses which are increasingly popular in the research community (e.g., in the use of polygenic scores, which may be less powerful or more biased in those of other ancestral groups).  We recommend that researchers acknowledge this in their data applications and write-up of their work.  

CLS is making efforts to address this issue – the millennium cohort study for example included oversampling of ethnically diverse areas and can be included in ongoing initiatives to increase diversity in genetic research. At CLS we are exploring the feasibility of creating polygenic scores for all cohort participants regardless of ancestry.
