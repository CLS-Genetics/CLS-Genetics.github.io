# **Use of CLS cohort data in GWAS**

The rich phenotyping of the CLS cohorts, longitudinal repeat measure data, and their high participation rates make them  highly suitable for both discovery and holdout/prediction samples in GWAS. 

To faciliate greater use of the CLS data, we have set up a streamlined process for including the cohorts in large-scale collaborative GWAS. Under this process data will be stored locally at UCL and will be cleaned/analysed by CLS analysts who have expertise in genetic data and experience conducting large-scale collaborative GWAS. In addition to this we are happy to provide support on data specific queries such as phenotype availability, definition and choice of measurement occasion. 

If you would like to discuss this further, please contact [Gemma Shireby](mailto:g.shireby@ucl.ac.uk), [Tim Morris](mailto:t.t.morris@ucl.ac.uk) and [David Bann](mailto:david.bann@ucl.ac.uk).
