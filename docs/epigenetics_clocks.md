# **Epigenetic clocks** 

## Our Aim

We aim to derive multiple epigenetic clocks measurements for the CLS cohorts. This includes both first generation (e.g. the Horvath and Hannum clocks) and second generation (phenoAge, GrimAge and DunedinPACE) epigenetic clocks. Our approach to sharing these data seeks to balance the ethical need to make data available to enable research with the ethical need to avoid potential risks.

These variables will be made available on UKDS via special license; likely by end of 2024.


## Data availability

Forthcoming / in preparation. Please email clsdata@ucl.ac.uk for updates.
