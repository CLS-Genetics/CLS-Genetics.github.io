# **Introduction** 

The Centre for Longitudinal Studies ([CLS](https://cls.ucl.ac.uk)) maintains genetic data from four British birth cohorts: the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), Next Steps (1989-90), and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS, 2000-02). This site provides technical documentation and access information for researchers.

## Data Access

Pseudonymised genomic data and polygenic indices/scores are available without charge to the global research community upon data application request.

To access genetic data combined with survey data, please see <a href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/data-access-training/data-access/">link</a> (i.e., complete the application form which is then reviewed approximately monthly in data access committee meetings; the same process applies to internal and external applicants). The <a href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/CLS_Data_Access_Framework.pdf">CLS Data Access Framework</a> gives further details on the application process, including details on ethics and socially controversial research. The flowchart below shows the access procedure through the CLS DAC.

A list of approved applications is held <a href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/dac_projects_register.pdf">here</a>.

## Genetic data

There are two main types of genomic data available to researchers at present: genotype array data and genotype array data imputed to sequence level density. Imputation has been performed several times as new sequenced reference panels become available. 

## Updates:

- **2024**: TOPMed imputation completed across all cohorts
- **Coming 2025**: Polygenic scores for multiple health and social traits ([details](/docs/PRS.html))
